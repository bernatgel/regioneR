CHANGES IN VERSION 1.18.0
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Expanded toGRanges support. It is now possible to transform coverage 
    objects (i.e. toGRanges(coverage(A))) into GRanges. It also supports 
    ".assoc" files produced by PLINK.
    o overlapPermTest now supports multiple region sets in B and will perform
    a multi- permutation test against each one much faster than testing them 
    independently.
    
BUG FIXES

    o Multiple bug fixes


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.2
-----------------------

BUG FIXES

    o createRandomRegions ignored the non.overlapping argument. It does work now.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.13.1
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Revamped toGRanges now accepts genome region descriptions as used by  
    UCSC and IGV ("chr9:23000-25000"). It also may take a genome parameter
    and set the genome information of the GRanges accordingly.


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.9.2
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Simplified the interface of toGRanges for simpler use when manually 
      creating GRanges. Now toGRanges("chr1", 10, 20) is valid.

BUG FIXES

    o Multiple minor bug fixes
    
    

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.8
-----------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Added new functionality to permTest to use multiple evaluation functions
      with a single randomization procedure. This gives a significant speedup 
      when comparing a single region set with multiple other features

    o Created a new function createFunctionsList() that given a function 
      and a list of values, creates a list of curried functions
      (e.g with one parameter preassigned to each of the given values)
      
PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

    o Complete rewrite of randomizeRegions() resulting in a 10 to 100 fold speedup

BUG FIXES

    o Multiple minor bug fixes
